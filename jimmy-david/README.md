# Templating with Handlebars.js

**Author**: David Stoll & Jimmy Chang
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We want to utilize a template for populating our HTML to simplify the code going through our program. We also want to refactor our functions into arrow functions where possible.

## Getting Started
Use a CDN for handlebars.js and create a template script to include in the html head. After, in our javascript file we find the script using a specific id, which we will then use to compile the information with Handlebars.compile().
For the arrow function, we identify where arrow functions would still work and change the syntax to match arrow functions.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, & Handlebars.js
